            // 6: Open HashNode Address in the "Dissect data/structure" window of CheatEngine program.
            // 7: @ 0x08 is the Root HashNode. Copy that value (copy xxxx in i.e. p-> xxxxxx)

            //     Maximum Offset Value: 1024 is enough
            //     Maximum Level: 2 is enough, if you don't find anything increase to 3.
